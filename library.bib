	abstract = {Information hiding techniques like steganography are used by hackers to obfuscate malicious attack codes to carry malware scripts and deliver to crypto-miners in on-demand platforms like Cloud. Stegware is a type of information-hiding malware that employs steganography to avoid detection by modern malware detection systems. This work proposes a Stegware detection system that recognizes obfuscated payloads from input images and verifies whether the obfuscated payload is the target of any stegware attack. The proposed system detects the stegware in four phases: Obfuscated Payload Detection phase that detects the presence of any obfuscated item concealed inside the digital medium; Obfuscated Payload Extraction phase that decodes stego-repository images to extract the data that are steganographically obfuscated inside the input; Obfuscated Payload Classification phase that detects whether the extracted data is legitimate or malicious stegware file, using binary classifier; Calculation of malicious percentage phase that uses fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to calculate the quantum and frequency of malicious activities. The proposed system is experimentally tested on real dataset and analyzed with existing models. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed Stegware detection system detects the steganographically-hidden attacks and identifies malicious activities in percentage terms as compared to other models.},

	abstract = {Malware distribution to the victim network is commonly performed through file attachments in phishing email or from the internet, when the victim interacts with the source of infection. To detect and prevent the malware distribution in the victim machine, the existing end device security applications may leverage techniques such as signature or anomaly-based, machine learning techniques. The well-known file formats Portable Executable ({PE}) for Windows and Executable and Linkable Format ({ELF}) for Linux based operating system are used for malware analysis, and the malware detection capabilities of these files has been well advanced for real-time detection. But the malware payload hiding in multimedia using steganography detection has been a challenge for enterprises, as these are rarely seen and usually act as a stager in sophisticated attacks. In this article, to our knowledge, we are the first to try to address the knowledge gap between the current progress in image steganography and steganalysis academic research focusing on data hiding and the review of the stegomalware (malware payload hiding in images) targeting enterprises with cyberattacks current status. We present the stegomalware history, generation tools, file format specification description. Based on our findings, we perform the detail review of the image steganography techniques including the recent Generative Adversarial Networks ({GAN}) based models and the image steganalysis methods including the Deep Learning({DL}) models for hiding data detection. Additionally, the stegomalware detection framework for enterprise is proposed for anomaly based stegomalware detection emphasizing the architecture details for different network environments. Finally, the research opportunities and challenges in stegomalware generation and detection are also presented.},

	abstract = {This research proposes a novel high-capacity-based reversible data embedding strategy for e-healthcare applications. The proposed reversible embedding scheme for electronic patient records ({EPR}) replaced the conventional embedding and interpolation techniques with a simple pixel-to-block-level transformation, repeated pixel differencing ({RPD}) and conditional pixel permutation ({CPP}) strategies. A fragile watermark image combined with {EPR} is employed to identify tamper detection in medical stego-images. In the proposed pixel-to-block conversion, a pixel is replicated to a 2 × 2 pixel block to facilitate the reversibility of {EPR} data. For embedding, {RPD} determines and adjusts the 2 × 2 pixel differences based on {EPR} and watermark data. Further, to ensure high imperceptibility for the human visual system proposed scheme computes the average value of pixels that must similar to the seed pixel. To maintain a histogram invariant stego-images, a permutation of 2 × 2 pixels is employed to embed additional secret data bits while exploiting the {CPP} strategy. The proposed scheme is extensively evaluated on + 2000 images regarding embedding capacity, perceptual imperceptibility, and tamper detection while employing different image processing attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieved an average of 2.24 bpp with 41.27 {dB} {PNSR} on medical images and 2.49 bpp with 40.68 {PSNR} with general images. The proposed strategy outperformed existing approaches in terms of high embedding capacity, acceptable visual imperceptibility, and tamper detection while ensuring the 100\% reversibility of {EPR} data in medical images.},

	abstract = {Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyright by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by {AI} models. We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and empirical results, we show that all invisible watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed attack. For a particularly resilient watermark, {RivaGAN}, regeneration attacks remove 93-99\% of the invisible watermarks while the baseline attacks remove no more than 3\%. However, if we do not require the watermarked image to look the same as the original one, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attack. Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantically similar ones.

Although existing methods embed watermarks imperceptibly and demonstrate robustness against attacks, they typically lack resilience against geometric transformations. Therefore, this paper proposes a new watermarking method that is robust against geometric attacks. The proposed method is based on the existing {HiDDeN} architecture that uses deep learning for watermark encoding and decoding. We add new noise layers to this architecture, namely for a differentiable {JPEG} estimation, rotation, rescaling, translation, shearing and mirroring. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art when it comes to geometric robustness. In conclusion, the proposed method can be used to protect images when viewed on consumers' devices.},

We present {WAVES} (Watermark Analysis Via Enhanced Stress-testing), a novel benchmark for assessing watermark robustness, overcoming the limitations of current evaluation methods.{WAVES} integrates detection and identification tasks, and establishes a standardized evaluation protocol comprised of a diverse range of stress tests. The attacks in {WAVES} range from traditional image distortions to advanced and novel variations of diffusive, and adversarial attacks. Our evaluation examines two pivotal dimensions: the degree of image quality degradation and the efficacy of watermark detection after attacks. We develop a series of Performance vs. Quality 2D plots, varying over several prominent image similarity metrics, which are then aggregated in a heuristically novel manner to paint an overall picture of watermark robustness and attack potency. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals previously undetected vulnerabilities of several modern watermarking algorithms. We envision {WAVES} as a toolkit for the future development of robust watermarking systems. The project is available at https://wavesbench.github.io/},

	abstract = {Watermarking the outputs of generative models is a crucial technique for tracing copyright and preventing potential harm from {AI}-generated content. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking that robustly fingerprints diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling, Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process, resulting in a model fingerprint that is invisible to humans. The watermark embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector used for sampling. These patterns are structured in Fourier space so that they are invariant to convolutions, crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then checked for the embedded signal. We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in {FID}. Our watermark is semantically hidden in the image space and is far more robust than watermarking alternatives that are currently deployed.

This paper introduces an active strategy combining image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Models. The goal is for all generated images to conceal an invisible watermark allowing for future detection and/or identification. The method quickly fine-tunes the latent decoder of the image generator, conditioned on a binary signature. A pre-trained watermark extractor recovers the hidden signature from any generated image and a statistical test then determines whether it comes from the generative model. We evaluate the invisibility and robustness of the watermarks on a variety of generation tasks, showing that Stable Signature works even after the images are modified. For instance, it detects the origin of an image generated from a text prompt, then cropped to keep \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the content, with \$90\$+\${\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy at a false positive rate below 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$.},

The commonly present disadvantages in traditional watermarking techniques such as inability to withstand attacks are absent in {SVD} based algorithms. They offer a robust method of watermarking with minimum or no distortion. {DCT} based watermarking techniques offer compression while {DWT} based compression offer scalability. Thus all the three desirable properties can be utilized to create a new robust watermarking technique. In this paper, we propose a method of non-blind transform domain watermarking based on {DWT}-{DCT}-{SVD}. The {DCT} coefficients of the {DWT} coefficients are used to embed the watermarking information. This method of watermarking is found to be robust and the visual watermark is recoverable without only reasonable amount of distortion even in the case of attacks. Thus the method can be used to embed copyright information in the form of a visual watermark or simple text.},

Specifically, digital images pose a potential threat due to their massive use, innocuous appearance, and ability to hide data without noticeably degrading the quality. Detecting malicious image steganography is a challenge for intrusion detection systems or static detection that lack analyzing the pixels of an image. This paper presents a tool in python to detect malware in widely used {JPEG} image format. The existing methods have mostly focused on finding steganography artifacts or used feature-based analysis that lacks revealing the hidden malign data. Unlike existing ones, the proposed tool alongside classification locates malicious content in {JPEG} images with revealing the found malign data along with its location as the output. This functionality to the best of our knowledge has not been found in the available literature. The tool has analyzed three types of {JPEG} images: malicious, benign, and stego images. Though malicious images are also stego ones, the paper refers to those hiding non-malicious data as the stego images. This is to evaluate the effectiveness of our tool in classifying the images with malicious and non-malicious data hidden. As a result, the tool has attained a low False Negative Rate ({FNR}) of 0.08 and False Positive Rate ({FPR}) of 0.001 with a better detection rate relative to state-of-the-art techniques. Indeed, it has predicted all stego images as non-malicious. Also, the paper has assessed the detection of Windows applications containing stegomalware.},

Steganography detection is a digital image forensic topic that is relatively unknown in practical forensics, although stego app use in the wild is on the rise. This paper introduces the first database consisting of mobile phone photographs and stego images produced from mobile stego apps, including a rich set of side information, offering simulated digital evidence. {StegoAppDB}, a steganography apps forensics image database, contains over 810,000 innocent and stego images using a minimum of 10 different phone models from 24 distinct devices, with detailed provenanced data comprising a wide range of {ISO} and exposure settings, {EXIF} data, message information, embedding rates, etc. We develop a camera app, Cameraw, specifically for data acquisition, with multiple images per scene, saving simultaneously in both {DNG} and high-quality {JPEG} formats. Stego images are created from these original images using selected mobile stego apps through a careful process of reverse engineering. {StegoAppDB} contains cover-stego image pairs including for apps that resize the stego dimensions. We retainthe original devices and continue to enlarge the database, and encourage the image forensics community to use {StegoAppDB}. While designed for steganography, we discuss uses of this publicly available database to other digital image forensic topics.},

	abstract = {Digital image forensics is a young but maturing field, encompassing key areas such as camera identification, detection of forged images, and steganalysis. However, large gaps exist between academic results and applications used by practicing forensic analysts. To move academic discoveries closer to real-world implementations, it is important to use data that represent "in the wild" scenarios. For detection of stego images created from steganography apps, images generated from those apps are ideal to use. In this paper, we present our work to perform steg detection on images from mobile apps using two different approaches: "signature" detection, and machine learning methods. A principal challenge of the {ML} task is to create a great many of stego images from different apps with certain embedding rates. One of our main contributions is a procedure for generating a large image database by using Android emulators and reverse engineering techniques. We develop algorithms and tools for signature detection on stego apps, and provide solutions to issues encountered when creating {ML} classifiers.},

In the last few decades, it has been an urgent concern for researchers to ensure the authenticity of digital images. Based on the desired applications, several suitable watermarking techniques have been developed to mitigate this concern. However, it is tough to achieve a watermarking system that is simultaneously robust and secure. This paper gives details of standard watermarking system frameworks and lists some standard requirements that are used in designing watermarking techniques for several distinct applications. The current trends of digital image watermarking techniques are also reviewed in order to find the state-of-the-art methods and their limitations.

Unlike existing literature, our study concentrates exclusively on image watermarking with deep learning, delivering an in-depth, yet brief analysis enriched by three fundamental contributions. First, we introduce a refined categorization, segmenting the field into Embedder-Extractor, Deep Networks as a Feature Transformation, and Hybrid Methods. This taxonomy, inspired by the varied roles of deep learning across studies, is designed to infuse clarity, offering readers technical insights and directional guidance. Second, our exploration dives into representative methodologies, encapsulating the diverse research directions and inherent challenges within each category to provide a consolidated perspective.

Military communications systems make increasing use of traﬃc security techniques which, rather than merely concealing the content of a message using encryption, seek to conceal its sender, its receiver or its very existence. Similar techniques are used in some mobile phone systems and schemes proposed for digital elections. Criminals try to use whatever traﬃc security properties are provided intentionally or otherwise in the available communications systems, and police forces try to restrict their use. However, many of the techniques proposed in this young and rapidly evolving ﬁeld can trace their history back to antiquity; and many of them are surprisingly easy to circumvent.

	abstract = {Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance. Attribution has many aspects—technical, political, legal, policy, and so on. A number of well-researched and executed papers cover one or more of these aspects, but integration of these aspects is usually left as an exercise for the analyst. This paper distinguishes between attribution of malicious cyber activity to a machine, to a specific perpetrator (often a human being pressing the keys) initiating that activity, and to an adversary that is deemed ultimately responsible for that activity. Which type of attribution is relevant depends on the goals of the relevant decisionmaker. Further, attribution is a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and geopolitics, among others. From the perspective of the victim, some degree of factual uncertainty attaches to any of these types of attribution, although the last type—attribution to an ultimately responsible party—also implicates to a very large degree legal, policy, and political questions. But from the perspective of the adversary, the ability to conceal its identity from the victim with high confidence is also uncertain. It is the very existence of such risk that underpins the possibility of deterring hostile actions in cyberspace.},

	url = {https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2019/10/ESET_Operation_Ghost_Dukes.pdf},
	abstract = {t is exceptionally rare for a well-documented threat actor, previously implicated in very high-profile attacks, to stay completely under the radar for several years. Yet, in the last three years that is what {APT} group the Dukes (aka {APT}29 and Cozy Bear) has done. Despite being well known as one of the groups to hack the Democratic National Committee in the run-up to the 2016 {US} election, the Dukes has received little subsequent attention. The last documented campaign attributed to them is a phishing campaign against the Norwegian government that dates back to January 2017. In this white paper, we describe how we uncovered that the Dukes had been running successful espionage campaigns while avoiding public scrutiny, thanks to stealthy communication techniques and retooling. We call these newly uncovered Dukes campaigns, collectively, Operation Ghost, and describe how the group has been busy compromising government targets, including three European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Washington {DC} embassy of a European Union country, all without drawing attention to their activities. Key points in this white paper: The Dukes never stopped their espionage activities. • Operation Ghost likely started in 2013. • The last known activity linked to Operation Ghost occurred in June 2019. • {ESET} researchers identified at least three victims: all European Ministries of Foreign Affairs including the Washington {DC} embassy of a European Union country. • The Dukes have used four new malware families in this campaign: {PolyglotDuke}, {RegDuke}, {FatDuke} and {LiteDuke}. • Operation Ghost uses a previously documented Dukes backdoor: {MiniDuke}. • The Dukes have leveraged online services such as Twitter, Imgur and Reddit to act as primary Command and Control (C\&C) channels for their first-stage malware. • The Dukes have used very stealthy techniques such as steganography to hide communications between compromised machines and their C\&C servers.

	abstract = {With the growth in internet usage, there is a proportional growth in security and privacy demands. In this paper, a three bit {XOR} steganography system for concealing messages into gray Images is projected. In this method, last three bits of pixel value offer 100 percentage of message addition. This new technique uses the {XOR} operation between the message and original image. If the intruder extracts the last three bits, he would not be able to find the meaning of the message as the message is in decoded form. The maximum no of bit which is to be hidden using this method is equal to the R*C*3, where R and C is the rows and column of the image. The time complexity is also calculated which is equal to O(1). Later on the method is analysed on the bases of {PSNR}, {MSE}, L2RAT and {MAXERR}. The projected technique is also matched with other similar techniques to show the superiority.},
